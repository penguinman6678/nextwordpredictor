Hello\
This repo contains the files for my next word predictor, which utilizes n-grams (such as unigram and bigram) derived from a corpus.\
Based on this, a Cassandra Database is made to store the n-grams in order to predict the next word given an input word. For example, when the input word "when" is given, an output could be "the". However, this is all dependent on the corpus utilized to build the n-grams.\
Future works include expanding the system to make next wordS prediction (ex: "when" --> "the people") and implementing onto a web server using tools such as Django.\n

Next update hopefully by November.\
